# Voxel engine made using OpenTK

Not really planning on making this into an actual game or anything, i was just having fun learning how to use opentk like this.
OpenTK is just a library that provides access to OpenGL functions in C#, it doesn't abstract anything for you.
I really want to learn Vulkan, which is known to be signifigantly harder to use but runs quite alot faster if done properly, though it doesn't really have a C# equivalent / Wrapper like OpenTK.
If i were to learn vulkan i would have to do it in C++ which i'm not as familiar with.
I'll probably do it eventually.
